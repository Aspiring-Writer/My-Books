<p>Nixarza watched as the warrior struck down the bandits as if they were wheat. She knew he was the one to free her the moment he stepped out of the forest and faced the monster that was her master; but hope did not swell in her chest, for the warrior was a fae prince and the fae were feared for a reason.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long before the jotunn were destroyed and the fae began to examine what was left in the camp. The prince eyed his new treasure, most of it being gold and jewels, before spotting her standing among the other cowering slaves. Their eyes met and magic stirred in her chest. He was her mate, perfect. Neither moved towards the other.</p>

<p>Another warrior approached the prince, “Well, Faelyn, what do you think of our recent find?”</p>

<p><em>‘Faelyn?’</em> She scowled, of course, Fate decided to lay down one of his strongest cards against her as soon as she was freed from hell.</p>

<p>Faelyn Farwynn, next in line for the Shadow Throne, turned to the warrior, “The fight was far too short for all the trouble they have caused, don’t you think Folluin?”</p>

<p>The slave rolled her eyes, Faelyn Farwynn went few places without Folluin Zingolor at his side. Both were known far across the land and characterized as the darker fae who rolled over the Shadow Realm.</p>

<p>Folluin chuckled, “Did you expect different?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Folluin followed Faelyn’s gaze, “What is that?”</p>

<p>Faelyn narrowed his eyes at her, “I do not know.”</p>

<p>She cocked her head, they truly had no idea what she was? Interesting.</p>

<p>Folluin eyed her from head to toe, “Looks like one of the better versions of the dragonkin.”</p>

<p>She scoffed, was that a complement or an insult?</p>

<p>“What are you?”</p>

<p>She gazed back at the prince and the three stared at each other.</p>

<p>“She does not speak.”</p>

<p>Faelyn and Folluin glanced at the young slave who had spoken. The dryad cowered and looked at her feet, “She has been here before all of us, and we have never heard her speak.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?” Folluin addressed her.</p>

<p>“Nandina, my lord.”</p>

<p>“What is she, then?”</p>

<p>Nandina looked at the being in question, “Válgr had called her Nixarza, but I do not know if that is her real name or not.”</p>

<p>The three looked at Nixarza as if she would rectify her own name.</p>

<p>“I do not know what she is.” Nandina whispered, “Válgr never said, yet he treasured her above everything he owned.”</p>

<p>Nixarza grew tired of the conversation and instead examined the battlefield to find the master in question.</p>

<p>Folluin stepped forward, “Válgr is dead.”</p>

<p>Nixarza ignored him and followed Válgr’s scent to his rotting body. She grabbed his hand and scowled at his barren finger. She searched around his body, the ring was not there.</p>

<p>“Looking for this?”</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed onto the ring Faelyn held between his two fingers. He did not wear it, so he must not know what it was. Then again, he did not know what she was, so of course he did not wear the ring.</p>

<p>Nixarza cocked her head as she examined the two. She didn’t break her gaze as fire fell from her fingertips to devour Válgr’s remains. Folluin took a defensive position slightly in front of his prince, and Nandina slowly backed away. Nixarza took her time walking towards the prince. When she stood a few feet away, she held her hand out and beckoned Faelyn to give her the ring.</p>

<p>“You will not tell me what it is, will you?”</p>

<p>Nixarza said nothing.</p>

<p>“Why should I give it to you then?”</p>

<p>She narrowed her eyes slightly and held up her other hand. The threat was clear, give me the ring or I shall see how quick you burn.</p>

<p>Faelyn didn’t flinch, “It is unwise to threaten a fae prince, especially one from the Shadow Realm.”</p>

<p>Nixarza cocked her head, the fae prince really didn’t know what, or who, she was. She smiled and struck. Folluin swung his sword up, but Nixarza spun to avoid the blade and grabbed Faelyn’s arm. He was waiting for her and struck her wrist with a dagger. Nixarza growled and jumped back just as Folluin’s blade crashed down where her back would have been. She snarled at the two. Faelyn now had two blades in his hand and rotated his wrists.</p>

<p>“This ring must be crucial,” he smirked, “for you to be so foolish to attack me and my second.”</p>

<p>Nixarza just snarled back at him. Many warriors had fought and died for that ring, but he would not know that. He was a fool.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it has some powerful magic attached to it and my prince should just put it on.” Folluin remarked.</p>

<p>Nixarza snarled. Fools, both of them. That ring’s magic was too great for a fae, it would kill him. She struck again, however, this time she went straight for Folluin. She sent a blast of fire that drove him back several feet. Faelyn swung with his twin blades, she grabbed them both with her claws, and threw him away from Folluin. She stalked towards Faelyn, who was picking himself up from the ground. Folluin tried to rush her, but she sent another blast of fire towards him, and he had no choice but to block it. Nixarza sent another blast towards Faelyn, and he blocked it. She grabbed his wrists and growled. He tried to kick her, but she blocked it and shoved him. Faelyn fell onto his back, and she landed on him. Fire danced on her fingers and Faelyn cried out as it burned his wrists. The mate bond sharply pulled on her, and it was as if someone dumped water on her. She hissed. The next time she saw Fate, she would strangle the man and carve out his bones. Nixarza swore she heard Fate chuckle, daring her to try.</p>

<p>Folluin, no longer having flames to distract him, rushed towards his fallen prince. He grabbed her hair and tried to pull her off him. Nixarza snarled.</p>

<p>A horn blared through the air and the three froze. Towards the south, an army of jotunn raced towards them. Nixarza rolled her eyes and stood up. Folluin shoved her aside and lifted Faelyn up.</p>

<p>“Gorgon witch.” Faelyn snapped at her.</p>

<p>She barred her teeth back at him.</p>

<p>Folluin eyed her, “She is no gorgon, not like any I have come across.”</p>

<p>Nixarza ignored them and focused on the approaching army. The fae army were yelling orders and assembling before the camp.</p>

<p>Folluin sighed, “It seems like you will have your battle now, Faelyn.”</p>

<p>A few jotunn and their army were now yards from the front line. Nixarza could make out their commander, whom she recognized as Aglfot, Válgr’s cousin, here to avenge the deaths of his kin.</p>

<p>She felt Faelyn’s glare at her back, “Are you fighting with us or against us?”</p>

<p>She ignored him and released some of her power. Her wings grew wider, her hair lengthened, and the talons on both her hands and legs extended. With a final glare back at the two fae, she launched herself into the sky, straight towards Aglfot. She would prefer fae over jotunn any day.</p>

<p>Nixarza landed beside Aglfot and fought her way to him.</p>

<p>“So, you’ve changed allegiances, have you?” Aglfot laughed, “Or has one of those elves found a way to wear the ring?”</p>

<p>She scowled at him and sent a fireball as her answer. The seven-and-a-half-foot oaf only laughed as he swung his axe. The two fought as fae, jotunn, goblins, orcs, and a few ogres battled around them. The jotunn and ogres towered over the fae, but the fae held their own quite well with magic on their side. Everywhere, fire, ice, water, earth, and wind dotted the battlefield. Occasionally, shadow and light were seen as well. Few tried to get in the way of the two beings battling in the middle, and for that Nixarza was glad, it allowed her to focus solely on Aglfot and his schemes. Twice now he had tried to leash her with his magic and failed. He was nothing like his cousin and without the ring Aglfot had no chance of holding her. Speaking of which, where was that cursed fae prince? She turned in time to see Faelyn behead a jotunn. He had a different weapon now, one more attuned to his darker ways. Nixarza smiled, in a different age she probably would have found it absolutely delightful that her mate looked like the grim reaper with his scythe.</p>

<p>“Ignoring me, fire breather?”</p>

<p>She rolled her eyes as Aglfot tried to shave off one of her wings with his double-headed axe. A cry caught her attention and she felt someone taking her magic as pain flowed through the mate bond. With a scream, she snatched Aglfot’s axe from his hand, shoved it through his arm, and dove back towards the camp. Faelyn was on his knees, grasping his left hand, screaming.</p>
